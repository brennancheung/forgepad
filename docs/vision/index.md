# Forgepad Vision Documents

This directory contains the philosophical and theoretical foundations for Forgepad, an exploration lab for AI-augmented knowledge work.

## Document Structure

1. **[Augmenting Human Intellect](./augmenting-human-intellect.md)**
   - Douglas Engelbart's vision of computer-augmented human intelligence
   - The H-LAM/T system and bootstrapping principle
   - How augmentation differs from automation
   - Relevance to modern AI systems

2. **[Notation as a Tool of Thought](./notation-as-tool-of-thought.md)**
   - Kenneth Iverson's insights on how notation shapes thinking
   - The APL philosophy and array thinking
   - Characteristics of effective notation systems
   - Implications for AI interface design

3. **[The Immediate Connection](./immediate-connection.md)**
   - Bret Victor's principles of immediate feedback
   - Direct manipulation and dynamic representations
   - Making invisible processes visible
   - The humane representation of thought

4. **[Forgepad Synthesis](./forgepad-synthesis.md)**
   - How these three visions converge in Forgepad
   - Specific design principles and explorations
   - Research questions being investigated
   - The experimental nature of the project

## Key Themes

### Augmentation Over Automation
Following Engelbart, Forgepad seeks to amplify human intelligence rather than replace it. AI is a partner, not a substitute.

### Notation Shapes Thought
Following Iverson, we explore how the interface and interaction patterns fundamentally shape how users think about problems.

### Immediate Feedback
Following Victor, every action provides instant, visible feedback. The system's behavior is never hidden or delayed.

### The Stack Paradigm
The stack serves as:
- **Notation**: A way to express computational thinking
- **Augmentation**: Making thought processes visible and manipulable
- **Immediate Feedback**: Every operation instantly shows its result

## Reading Order

For the best understanding:
1. Start with the individual vision documents to understand the historical context
2. Read the synthesis to see how these ideas combine in Forgepad
3. Refer back to specific sections as needed during development

## Living Documents

These documents will evolve as we:
- Discover new connections between these visions
- Learn from user experiments
- Develop new features and capabilities
- Refine our understanding of AI-augmented knowledge work

## Contributing

If you have insights about:
- How these historical visions apply to modern AI
- New thinkers whose work should inform Forgepad
- Experiments that could test these ideas
- Refinements to our interpretation

Please share them. Forgepad is an exploration, and all perspectives are valuable.
